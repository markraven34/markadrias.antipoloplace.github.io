  Description
</p>
        XentroMall Antipolo, located along Sumulong Highway in Barangay
        Mambugan, Antipolo City, officially opened its doors to the public on
        June 21, 2018. Developed and managed by XRC Mall Developer, Inc., the
        mall was built to provide a convenient shopping destination for the
        growing community in Antipolo and nearby areas, offering a more
        accessible alternative to larger malls in Metro Manila. Designed as a
        three-story community mall, it houses a variety of retail shops, dining
        establishments, and service centers, aiming to meet the everyday needs
        of local residents. The mall gained national recognition in 2018 when it
        won the Golden Kubeta Award for maintaining one of the cleanest public
        restrooms in the country. In a significant development, XentroMall
        Antipolo was declared a special economic zone on November 22, 2024,
        under Proclamation No. 752, designating it as an Information Technology
        (IT) center. This ecozone status allows for business incentives and
        encourages IT-related enterprises to operate within its premises. With a
        land area of 10,898 square meters and a floor area of over 27,000 square
        meters, the mall continues to play an essential role in both the local
        economy and community life in Antipolo.

        it was declared a special economic zone on November 22, 2024, under
        Proclamation No. 752, officially designating it as an Information
        Technology (IT) Center. This means the mall is now recognized as a hub
        for IT and BPO companies, making it eligible for government incentives
        through the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA). The ecozone
        status not only boosts business opportunities in the area but also
        positions the mall as a potential employment center in Antipolo.
        Additionally, XentroMall Antipolo has become a key part of the local
        community due to its accessible location along Sumulong Highway in

        like an elaborate Christmas lights display, a ‚ÄúChristmas village‚Äù theme,
        merry go rounds, train sets, etc., which are free for the public. These
        help create a sense of community and make the mall more than just a
        place to shop.Overall, its blend of economic significance and strong
        community engagement makes XentroMall Antipolo uniquely special in the
        region
