      <h2>History of Antipolo</h2>
      <ul>
        On the Philippine island of Luzon, in the province of Rizal, sits the
        town of Antipolo. San Mateo and La Paz to the north, Calumpit to the
        west, Quezon City and Pasig to the south, and Manila Bay to the east are
        its neighbors. It is situated at a height of around 6 meters above sea
        level. The tipolo (breadfruit) tree, which was common in the region,
        inspired the naming of Antipolo City. Antipolo City is the first city in
        Rizal. It was established in 1570 by Miguel de Legazpi, the first
        governor-general of the Philippines, as a place for religious retreats
        and a base for his explorations. The Spanish government built a military
        fortress here to protect themselves from Moro attacks.In 1571, Fray
        Andres de Urdaneta came here to spread Christianity to the natives. He
        started on November 6 and finished on December 20, 1571. He baptized a
        total of two hundred twenty-one people in two weeks and established six
        missions in Antipolo. Fray Juan Crespi also came with Fray Andres de
        Urdaneta to establish another mission here on June 5, 1572. It was named
        San Pablo de Tiaong after Saint Paul’s New Testament book bearing the
        same name Antipolo joined the newly created Province of Rizal, along
        with the municipalities of Morong District and Manila Province, on June
        11, 1901. Antipolo, Boso-Boso, and Teresa were combined in 1903. The
        sitios of Mayamot and Bulao have added to the town’s boundaries once
        again in 1913, but Teresa was lost when it split off to form an
        independent municipality six years later. On December 24, 1908, the
        Manila Railroad Company began operating a train line to Antipolo. After
        plebiscite approval on April 4, 1998, former President Fidel V. Ramos
        signed Republic Act No. 8508, establishing the Municipality of Antipolo
        as a component city of Rizal Province. In the election that followed,
        Angelito Gatlabayan was chosen as the city’s first mayor.

        Antipolo City, named for its abundant Tipolo trees, has a history
        beginning with indigenous tribes and Franciscan missionaries in 1578,
        evolving into a significant religious site due to the Our Lady of Peace
        and Good Voyage icon and later a political center for the Province of
        Rizal. The town grew through Jesuit influence, established as a parish
        in 1650, and later became the capital of Rizal Province in 1901. It was
        officially converted to a component city in 1998. Another name for
        Antipolo is “Pilgrimage City.” It was the Franciscan missionaries who
        first build the church in the area, in 1578. However, they were replaced
        by the Jesuits. The missionaries came to “Christianize” the Dumagatas,
        Tagals, Indians, and Aetas. Some of them were Fr. Chirino and Fr.
        Almarique. By 1601, the Christian population of Antipolo increased to
        3,000 due to the people of Dumagat who came and lived in the area.
