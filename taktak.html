          Description
        </p>

        Hinulugang Taktak doesn't have a specific "built" or "discovered" date,
        as it's a natural waterfall with a legend of its naming from the 15th or
        16th century when a bell was dropped there. It became a designated
        recreation area in 1952 and was later declared a National Park in 1990
        under a specific law.
        <p></p>
        Hinulugang Taktak is a 70-foot waterfall and a designated national park
        in Antipolo City, Rizal, Philippines. It is a popular natural tourist
        spot named after the legend of a large bell (taktak) being dropped
        (hinulog) into it in the 16th century to end a priest's suffering from
        its unbearable ringing. The park features a scenic waterfall, lush
        greenery, and is managed by the Department of Environment and Natural
        Resources and the Rizal Provincial Government.
        <p></p>
        Hinulugang Taktak Protected Landscape, also known as Hinulugan Taktak,
        is a protected area in Rizal, Philippines. Initially assigned as a
        recreation area, the waterfall area has been designated as a national
        park by virtue of Republic Act No. 6964 in 1990. Ten years later, it
        became a protected landscape under Proclamation No. 412. It is managed
        by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Rizal
        Provincial Government.
        <p></p>
        Hinulugang Taktak in Antipolo. This is famous waterfall, the Prime
        tourist spot of Old Antipolo. Green leaves, smooth ambiance, healthy
        environment, clean sorroundings, clean flowing water, sweet chirping of
        the birds, people enjoying the place. Children playing as their mothers
        rinsed the laundry upstream, different kinds of fish visible in the
        water so clear that even the colors of fascinating butterflies were
        reflected on the water.
        <p></p>
        Activities in Hinulugang Taktak include picnicking, walking on nature
        trails and hanging bridges, swimming in the park's pool, and exploring
        the area for its lush flora and fauna. Visitors can also enjoy views of
        the waterfall, with some sites mentioning free entrance for both the
        park and some activities.
