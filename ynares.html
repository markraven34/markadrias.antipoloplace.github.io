          Description
        </p>

        The Ynares Center is a multipurpose indoor arena located in Antipolo
        City, Rizal, Philippines. Opened in 2000, it was built at a cost of
        around ‚Ç±350 million and is owned and operated by the Rizal Provincial
        Government. Named after the influential Ynares political family, who
        have held key government positions in Rizal, the center serves as a hub
        for various events including sports tournaments, concerts, religious
        gatherings, and official provincial functions. With a seating capacity
        of approximately 7,400 and situated on a 50,000-square-meter lot, the
        Ynares Center also houses multiple function rooms, government offices,
        and parking for over 400 vehicles. Over the years, it has hosted
        Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) games, collegiate tournaments,
        boxing matches, and large-scale public celebrations, making it a
        landmark venue and cultural centerpiece in the province of Rizal. The
        Ynares Center becomes a popular tourist spot during the "Ber" months
        (September to December) mainly because it serves as a central venue for
        holiday celebrations, cultural events, and large-scale gatherings in
        Antipolo and the province of Rizal.
